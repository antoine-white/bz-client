# AAW client project. Simple bank with react/typescript

## I am well awared that you said to avoid using create-react-app but I still use it for multiple reasons:
* doing parcel with both react and ts seems complicated(https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/issues/1199)
* easy to deploy on Netlify
* I'm a bit allergic to tsconfig files (deno greate for that )
* I always did it that way
